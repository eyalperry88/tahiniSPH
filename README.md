## Background

Tahini is amazing. A condiment made from toasted ground hulled sesame, tahini can be added to a variety of dishes and drinks to improve taste, texture and [nutritional value](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168604/nutrients). 

Tahini is best when purchased as 100% sesame paste.

To prepare it, water, lemon and favorite spices are slowly added and stirred. In this process, something very odd happens. The tahini at room temperature starts as a viscous fluid. As water is added to the mixture, the tahini goes through a *phase shift* and becomes granular solid. As more water is added, the tahini returns to a fluid and delicious state.

Video demonstration:

Notice that while sharing certain similarities, Tahini is *not* a "classical" non-Newtonian fluid, which exhibits phase shifts as response to stress. Tahini's phase is defined the amount of water in the system, and the solid phase is dependent on "just the right amount" - too little or too much water, and tahini is still liquid (viscous, but liquid). Not exhibited in the video, having the right amount for a long time creates such a solid piece of Tahini that it might break a blender. Be careful.

This process is sometimes described as "seizing" and is not unique to Tahini.
